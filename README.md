The Fitness Reward Application is an innovative project designed to promote proper exercise form and technique through real-time feedback and rewards. Built using motion tracking technologies like MediaPipe, OpenCV, and advanced machine learning models, the application ensures users perform exercises with accuracy and efficiency.
The application tracks users' movements during workouts by analyzing body posture, joint angles, and motion patterns. Using motion tracker models, it evaluates the form and technique for exercises like squats or curls,ensuring users adhere to proper biomechanics to avoid injury. When the exercise is performed correctly, users are rewarded with points, which can be accumulated and redeemed for incentives such as fitness perks, discounts, or recognition within the app.
The project seamlessly integrates computer vision and machine learning to provide real-time visual feedback. Users can access the platform through a camera-enabled device, where their movements are captured and analyzed on the go. The intuitive interface guides them to make necessary adjustments to their posture or technique during the workout session.
This application not only encourages users to maintain proper form but also gamifies the fitness journey, making it more engaging and motivating. By combining fitness education with rewards, it helps users achieve their goals safely and effectively while fostering long-term adherence to healthy habits.
